Installing libsoc for cross-compiling

Source: https://github.com/jackmitch/libsoc/issues/29

Commands:
./configure --target=arm-linux-gnueabihf --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf --build=x86_64-linux
make clean // if you have already installed the library
make V=1
make install

Commands that might help:
./configure --help // seeing help to use the configure command
file /usr/local/lib/libsoc.so.2.4.2 // seeing for what architecture the librarie binary was installed 
ln -s configure ./configure-xablaus // making a link to a file

Cross-compiling the test code:
ln -s libsoc.so.2.4.2 libsoc.so -> creating link to the librarie
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc gpio_test.c -L. -lsoc -o gpio -> indicate where the libraries are (-L.) and what to link (-libsoc)

Making the compilation time library(file with extension .a) with the files .o given in the installation:
cd .../libsoc/lib/ -> going to the directory where the .o were installed
arm-linux-gnueabihf-ar rs libsoc.a *.o 

Cross-compiling the code with the .a library:
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc gpio_test.c -L../../libsoc/lib -lsoc -lpthread -o gpio

g++ rmain.cpp libmystuff.a -o roll -> adding the library to the compile command
